            <h2>Loneliness</h2>
            <p>We all feel lonely from time to time. Feelings of loneliness are personal, so everyone's experience
                of loneliness will be different.
                One common description of loneliness is the feeling we get when our need for rewarding social
                contact and relationships is not met. But loneliness is not always the same as being alone.
                You may choose to be alone and live happily without much contact with other people, while others may
                find this a lonely experience.
                Feeling lonely isn't in itself a mental health problem, but the two are strongly linked. Having a
                mental health problem can increase your chance of feeling lonely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Older people are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation – and it can have a
                serious effect on health. But there are ways to overcome loneliness, even if you live alone and find
                it hard to get out.
                People can become socially isolated for a variety of reasons, such as getting older or weaker, no
                longer being the hub of their family, leaving the workplace, the deaths of spouses and friends, or
                through disability or illness.
                Whatever the cause, it's shockingly easy to be left feeling alone and vulnerable, which can lead to
                depression and a serious decline in physical health and wellbeing.
                Someone who's lonely probably also finds it hard to reach out. There's a stigma surrounding
                loneliness, and older people tend not to ask for help because they have too much pride.
                It's important to remember loneliness can – and does – affect anyone, of any age.
            </p>
            <h4>Loneliness in Older People</h4>
            <p>
                It is often a myth that elderly people are incapable or unwilling to engage with technology to stay
                connected. Often times, a simple lack of awareness of what is available is the issue. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are ways
                for older people to connect with others, and feel useful and appreciated again.
