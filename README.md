   ### Scope

   Within project conception, a list of features were compiled, these were the scored 
   between 1 & 5 for importance and feasibility/ viability which then decided which features 
   could be included for initial launch.    

   #### Current features

-   Accessible 

-   Easy to navigate (Single use learning)

-   Interactive elements

-   Social Links 

-   Ability to contact owner via contact page.


   #### Features to implement in the future

### Structure

## Challenges 


## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

 - ### Creation 

    I created this repository by:<br>
    (a) Logging into Github and clicked the green new button.<br>
    (b) I selected the code institute template, input a repository name and clicked the green create repository button.<br>
    (c) Opened new repository and clicked green Gitpod button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

  - ### Forking
    (a) To fork my project sign in to Github and go to [repository]()<br>
    (b) Above and to the right of the settings there are three options and the far right one says Fork, select this.<br>
    (c) The fork is now in your repositories.

  - ### Clone
    To clone my project sign in to Github and go to [repository]()<br>
   [Setting Up Project](#setting-up-app) and [Heroku Deployment](#heroku-deploment) for more information about what will be required to run project.

    *  Clone using command line 
        +  Next to the green Gitpod button is a button that says code, select this. There is a few options as to how you 
        would like to clone, if you choose https, SSH or Github CLI, select the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
        +  In your workspace that you've created, in the terminal , type git clone, paste the URL and enter.

    *  Desktop Github
        + If you choose to clone by selecting open with desktop Github, it will guide you through the clone with prompts.<br>

    For more information or troubleshooting see the Github documentation 
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#about-cloning-a-repository)

- ### Setting Up Project
   
    - Install requirements in terminal using pip3 install, see requirements below. If you have cloned my project you can use pip3 install -r requirements.txt which will install everything for you.
    - Create a SECRET_KEY for django to use. I used [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) for this. My settings.py file is set up to collect keys from the environment so name your variables accordingly. In github you go into settings from your dashboard and then variables. And add the following. You can complete the rest when you go through these sections. DEVELOPMENT value is set to True. Scope you can set to your repository name meaning its only accessible by that project or you can set it to */* meaning all your repositories can access them. 
    - Ensure you have requirements.txt file and Procfile. These are required by Heroku so ensure these are pushed to github prior to deployment. Ensure all requirements are saved by using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    - If using in development you will need to Run migrations usimg command python3 manage.py makemigrations and then python3 manage.py migrate. To create a superuser in the terminal to get access to admin panel, use command python3 manage.py createsuperuser and fill in details required.

- ### Heroku deployment
    - Log in to Heroku, click 'New' and select 'Create New App'. In window give the app a name and choose region closest to you and then click 'Create App'. Then in Resources under Add-ons, select Heroku Postgresql
    - In new app page select settings from menu, click reveal config vars. DATABASE_URL will have been pre-filled when you selected Postgres. SECRET_KEY was generated as before with Django Secret Key generator.
    - Next select 'Deploy' from menu, three options of deployment are available. If you select Heroku Git, it gives you step by step of what you need to do.
    - I chose to use Github, so you have to search and connect to your github repository. 
    - Click enable automatic deployment, below that in manual deploy section, you can pick and deploy a branch to ensure everything is set up correctly. 
    - You will now need to migrate and create superuser as above in Setting Up Project section.
